This project is written from scratch to address QOds's core shortcommings:

- Allow for editing (updating) .ods files
- Allow for a full test suite
- A much more sound core structure.

Built exactly as QOds, see sample/examples* for how to use.

For questions, feature requests, etc: f35f22fan@gmail.com

Licensed under the GPLv3, see LICENSE for details.

TBD (95% done, yet):
- Test/fix to work on windows
- Make sure generated files work with MS Office 2015+
- Create a sample invoice to show up what Ods2 can do.
- Detect possibly missing features to be on par with QOds
