Ods2 is written from scratch to address QOds's core shortcommings:
 - [x] Allow for editing (updating) .ods files
 - [x] Allow for a full test suite
 - [x] A much more sound core structure.

Built exactly as QOds, see subfolder sample/* for examples on how to use.

For questions, feature requests, etc: f35f22fan AT gmail.com

The file sample/Invoice.ods was created with Ods2, the source code
is in sample/Invoice.cpp

#### TBD
 - [ ] Test/fix to work on windows
